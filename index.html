            <p>Hi My name is Osborn Del Angel and I am originally from Vancouver, WA but now I currently live in Portland, OR with my wife and my daughter Olive. I've been working blue collar jobs since I've left highschool and I never went to college. I've done almost everything you can think of from construction to manufacturing. I didn't think higher learning was for me until I met Code Fellows. Mostly because I didn't have the means to go to college and I thought going to "shows" was going to be my life, but ever since my daughter was born I felt like I needed more than a paycheck bi-weekly. A career in Software Development is my thing now and I never want to go back. This is something that I genuinely love doing and I can't wait to continue doing for a long time.</p>
